                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>In earlier centuries, an all-vegetable-based soap was made in the Castile region of Spain from local olive oil. By the turn of this century, “Castile” had come to mean any vegetable oil-based soap, as distinct from animal (tallow) fat-based soap. “Pure-Castile” is now also your guarantee that what you are using is a genuinely ecological and simple soap – not a complex blend of detergents with higher ecological impact and slower biodegradability. Unfortunately, many synthetic detergent blends are deceptively labeled as “liquid soap” despite the fact that they contain absolutely no real soap whatsoever.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castile Liquid and Bar Soaps are both completely vegetable oil-based. The difference between the liquid and bar soaps is that the liquid soaps use potassium hydroxide to saponify the vegetable oils, while the hard bar soaps use sodium hydroxide instead.
                        </p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Absolutely not. Dr. Bronner’s soaps are 100% true pure-castile soaps. The high-foaming lather comes from their high coconut oil content, which creates a more luxurious and richer lather than any detergent could ever produce. “Pure-Castile” is your guarantee that what you’re using is a genuinely ecological and simple soap – not a complex blend of detergents with a higher environmental impact due to the waste stream created during manufacturing and the detergents’ slower biodegradability. Unfortunately, many synthetic detergent blends are deceptively labeled as “Liquid Soap” even though they contain no real soap whatsoever.

                        We do have one product, Sal Suds, which contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, and Lauryl Glucoside. Sal Suds is an all-purpose household cleaning product, and is not intended for use on the body. Cruelty-free and biodegradable, It is a balanced formulation of naturally derived surfactants that are mild and gentle on the hands.

Unfortunately, there isn’t much to be done in this case and our only recommendation is to switch to one of our other scents.

                        <p>In general, we recommend using Dr. Bronner’s body care products within three years of the manufacture date. Soaps are self-preserving, but because our products are biodegradable, it’s best to not leave them on the shelf for too long. Also, the soaps are good for 24 months after opening the product, within that 3 year window.
                        </p>
                        <p>To find out when our personal care products were manufactured, you can consult the “lot code,” a number that appears printed or etched on the packaging, typically just below the label. We do not use expiration dates, instead we use Julian dates. The first digits refers to the year (i.e., “17” is 2017, “20” is 2020, etc.), while the next three digits refer to the day of the year out of 365 total days. So if the first five digits of a lot code are “17165,” the product was manufactured in 2017 on the 165th day of that year (June 14th). You can always search for a Julian date calendar for the specific year that your bottle was manufactured in online.
                        </p>
                        <p>or easy reference, our Fair Trade & Organic Virgin Coconut Oils (VCOs) are labeled with a “Best By” date next to the lot code. Due to space limitations, we use a different system to code our Organic Lip Balms.

                        <p>Absolutely not. Dr. Bronner’s soaps are 100% true pure-castile soaps. The high-foaming lather comes from their high coconut oil content, which creates a more luxurious and richer lather than any detergent could ever produce. “Pure-Castile” is your guarantee that what you’re using is a genuinely ecological and simple soap – not a complex blend of detergents with a higher environmental impact due to the waste stream created during manufacturing and the detergents’ slower biodegradability. Unfortunately, many synthetic detergent blends are deceptively labeled as “Liquid Soap” even though they contain no real soap whatsoever.

                        We do have one product, Sal Suds, which contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, and Lauryl Glucoside. Sal Suds is an all-purpose household cleaning product, and is not intended for use on the body. Cruelty-free and biodegradable, It is a balanced formulation of naturally derived surfactants that are mild and gentle on the hands.

                        <p>It’s not common (most experience a “tingly cool” feeling from the menthol) but some people have told us they feel a burning sensation, especially over sensitive areas. Unfortunately, there isn’t much to be done in this case and our only recommendation is to switch to one of our other scents.
